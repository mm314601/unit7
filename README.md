Last commit.

This course was garbage the whole way through. I truly hated it.

This project looks like garbage, too, because I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how to fix it. I tried chatting with several advisors and spent three pair-programming sessions with my mentor on it, and it still looks terrible. I don't care any more. I'm just going to have to take another class after this to cover the stuff I was supposed to learn from this one.

Like that final project stuff? The matching game, the trackster thing, and so on? Those would have been awesome. There's no way I can code those now, though. I mean, I don't understand how to do it. It was a three-day elective in this one despite the course being marketed around "CHECK OUT THESE SWEET FINAL PROJECTS!" The real last final project was this one, and I didn't finish it, because I'm still too stupid to understand how to finish it.

Today I spent over an hour and a half waiting for advisors to be able to help me. Just waiting. No help was given. One advisor, Jessica, popped in for a little while, messaging me occasionally over the course of 40 minutes before her status switched to "Away." During that time, she did not give me a single bit of actual help. Just a huge block of code I didn't read, because why the hell would I? That's not helpful. That's just absurd.

You know what? I'm gonna attach it to this project. I'm calling the file "email.pdf."

I actually messaged her several more times after that. This is what I wrote ten minutes after her last message to me:

Can you walk me through the process, here? It having been 10 minutes, I'm worried you're just going to send me another big piece of code
It's probably the case that you're helping other students at the same time, of course, but still, I'm basically just sitting here waiting

Then, another five minutes later:

Alright, you're obviously very busy. I'm going to try messaging someone else. I really did not expect to be waiting longer than an hour to be told anything at all that I can do to fix my code
Oh! You're not even here! You're "Away!"
That explains it!

Then I tried to start a new conversation and waited ANOTHER TWENTY MINUTES.

I have stuff to do other than sit here and wait! I can't just be doing this all night! I know that maybe you think I should, but, seriously, what's even the point? So I can "learn"? I'm not gonna learn anything this late in the game. It's ridiculous.

So either give me credit for this or don't. I don't even care any more. Worst case is that I don't get my Codecademy credential. That's not a frightening prospect to me.
